        <h2 id="wish2"><i>On the occasion of New Year, I wish
            that you are always there with me to
            make each and every day a brighter
            and happier one. You have always
            filled up my heart with happiness, warmth
            and feelings that I had no idea
            existed in me. Thanks for making this
            year so special for me. I wish that
            each and every day of this upcoming
            year is as bright as the sparkle in
            your eyes, as lovely as the smile on
            your face and as beautiful as you my
            gorgeous queen ... I wish you all the
            happiness the world. Step
            into the coming year with a heart full
            of beautiful memories from past and
            lots of dreams for future. You are the
            reason for all my smiles, and for the person I've become.</i></h2>
